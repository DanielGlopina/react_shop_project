# 🛍️ React Online Store

**React Online Store** is a single-page application (SPA) that demonstrates the core functionality of an e-commerce interface: product filtering, dynamic rendering of item cards, cart management, and stock validation. It is built using modern front-end technologies with a focus on component-based architecture and responsive UI.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **React** — Main library for building the UI using reusable components and hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- **Vite** — Fast front-end build tool used for development and production builds
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** — Core programming language
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox** — For responsive and structured layout of the product cards and filters
- **Modular CSS** — For component-level styling
- **Conditional Rendering** — Displaying components based on state (e.g., when no products match the filters)
- **State Management** — Using React's built-in `useState` for filters, product data, and cart logic

## 📦 Features

- Dynamic rendering of product cards with:
  - Image, name, brand, gender, price, sizes
  - "Add to Cart" button with stock check
- Filtering capabilities:
  - By stock availability
  - By size (e.g., 38, 39, etc.)
  - By brand
  - By gender (Men/Women)
  - By partial name match (real-time search)
- Message shown when no products match the selected filters
- Basic cart logic:
  - Prevents adding duplicate products
  - Only allows adding products that are in stock
